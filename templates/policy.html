                <h5>Eligibility Criteria</h5>
                <p>
                    Students must maintain a minimum CGPA of 7.0 and have no active backlogs to participate in the placement process. 
                    Any exceptions will be considered on a case-by-case basis and may require approval from the placement cell.
                </p>

                <h5>Application Process</h5>
                <p>
                    Eligible students can apply to open positions through the placement portal. Each student can apply to a maximum of three 
                    positions at a time to ensure fair opportunity for all applicants.
                </p>

                <h5>Selection and Offers</h5>
                <p>
                    Once a student receives an offer, they will be removed from other ongoing processes unless it is a dream or super-dream offer. 
                    This policy is designed to prevent holding multiple offers and allow other candidates to participate.
                </p>

                <h5>Code of Conduct</h5>
                <p>
                    Students are expected to uphold integrity throughout the placement process. Any form of misrepresentation, 
                    including fake documents or incorrect information, will lead to disqualification from current and future placement activities.
                </p>

                <h5>Responsibilities</h5>
                <p>
                    Students are required to attend all pre-placement talks and company presentations as scheduled. Attendance is compulsory 
                    as it helps students make informed decisions about the roles they are applying for.
                </p>

                <h5>Guidelines</h5>
                <p>
                    Placements are a privilege extended to students by the institution. Students are expected to adhere to all guidelines and 
                    timelines as outlined by the placement cell, including deadlines for application submissions, resume updates, and interview schedules.
